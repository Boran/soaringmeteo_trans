  The wind speed and direction are shown with an arrow. The wind flows in the
  direction of the arrow. For instance, an arrow that points to the right means
  that the wind comes from west and goes to east. The number of barbells, in the
  arrow, indicate the speed with a precision of 2.5 km/h. For instance, an arrow
  with a single short arm indicate a speed between 0 and 2.5 km/h. If it has two
  short arms, it means a speed between 2.5 and 5 km/h. Two long arms mean a speed
  between 7.5 and 10 km/h. Four long arms mean a speed between 17.5 and 20 km/h,
  and so on. You can see some examples on the left of the screen.
